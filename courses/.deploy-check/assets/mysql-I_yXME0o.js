Once InnoDB hands out 101, a rollback does not return that number to the sequence, so the next insert normally receives 102. Gaps are therefore expected after rollbacks, failed inserts, or concurrent allocation; an auto-increment column should not be treated as a gap-free business sequence.`},{id:`mysql-36`,type:`mcq`,difficulty:`tricky`,category:`Deadlocks`,prompt:`Two transactions update the same two account rows:

Why can REPLACE be dangerous here?`,options:[`It updates only the changed columns and preserves the original row identity.`,`It deletes the conflicting row and inserts a new row, which can trigger foreign-key actions and delete dependent data.`,`It behaves exactly like INSERT IGNORE and leaves the existing row untouched.`,`It can only replace rows when the table has no foreign keys.`],correctAnswer:`It deletes the conflicting row and inserts a new row, which can trigger foreign-key actions and delete dependent data.`,explanation:`REPLACE is not a normal UPDATE. When a duplicate primary or unique key is found, MySQL removes the existing row and then inserts the new row.

Why is this index a strong match for the query?`,options:[`It filters by the equality column first, then reads matching rows in created_at order.`,`It ignores status and sorts the entire table because ORDER BY is always separate from indexes.`,`It works only because created_at is the first column in the index.`,`It guarantees no table access even though id is not stored in the index.`],correctAnswer:`It filters by the equality column first, then reads matching rows in created_at order.`,explanation:`The leading status column narrows the index range to paid orders.
