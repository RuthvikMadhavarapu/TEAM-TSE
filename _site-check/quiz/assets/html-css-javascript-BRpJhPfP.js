What is the result?`,options:[`Children are centered horizontally only`,`Children are centered vertically only`,`Children are centered both horizontally and vertically`,`Children stretch to fill the viewport`],correctAnswer:`Children are centered both horizontally and vertically`,explanation:`justify-content controls the main axis and align-items controls the cross axis. With the default flex-direction: row, this combination perfectly centers content in both directions.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-3`,type:`mcq`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`Responsive Design`,prompt:`A webpage looks perfect on desktop but requires horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.

What is the MOST likely cause?`,options:[`A fixed-width element wider than the viewport`,`Too many HTML comments`,`Using semantic HTML elements`,`Missing display: flex`],correctAnswer:`A fixed-width element wider than the viewport`,explanation:`Hardcoded widths such as width: 1200px commonly cause horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. Responsive layouts should prefer percentages, max-width, flexbox, or CSS Grid.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-4`,type:`code-review`,difficulty:`hard`,category:`Accessibility`,prompt:`A developer creates a button like this:

What should be investigated FIRST?`,options:[`CSS specificity and rule order`,`Restart the browser`,`Add !important everywhere`,`Replace the stylesheet`],correctAnswer:`CSS specificity and rule order`,explanation:`Conflicting selectors with higher specificity or later declarations often override expected styles. Understanding specificity is more effective than immediately using !important.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-6`,type:`mcq`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`Performance`,prompt:`A page contains 5,000 DOM elements and scrolling feels sluggish.

Which change is MOST likely to improve rendering performance?`,options:[`Reduce unnecessary DOM elements and nesting`,`Increase the z-index values`,`Use more inline styles`,`Replace all <div> elements with <span>`],correctAnswer:`Reduce unnecessary DOM elements and nesting`,explanation:`Large and deeply nested DOM trees increase rendering, layout, and repaint costs. Simplifying the DOM generally improves browser performance.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-7`,type:`code-output`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`CSS Box Model`,prompt:`An element has:

Total width = 200 + 20 + 20 + 5 + 5 = 250px. This is a common source of layout issues in CSS.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-8`,type:`mcq`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`CSS Positioning`,prompt:`A tooltip is absolutely positioned inside a card.

The tooltip has:

position: absolute;

Which implementation should be approved?`,options:[`Developer A`,`Developer B`,`Both are equivalent`,`Neither`],correctAnswer:`Developer B`,explanation:`max-width: 100% prevents images from overflowing while allowing smaller images to retain their natural size. height: auto preserves the aspect ratio during resizing.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-17`,type:`mcq`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`CSS Cascade`,prompt:`A CSS rule is not applied even though it appears later in the stylesheet.

Which is the MOST likely explanation?`,options:[`A selector with higher specificity overrides it`,`Browsers ignore later CSS rules`,`The stylesheet loaded successfully`,`HTML elements can only have one CSS rule`],correctAnswer:`A selector with higher specificity overrides it`,explanation:`The CSS cascade considers importance, specificity, and source order. A more specific selector can override a later, less specific rule.`},{id:`html-css-javascript-18`,type:`code-output`,difficulty:`expert`,category:`Box Model`,prompt:`A div has:
