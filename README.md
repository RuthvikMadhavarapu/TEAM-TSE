# TSE Learning Hub

A collaborative website for Trainee Software Engineers (TSE) to introduce
themselves, track their learning, and practice real Git/GitHub workflows —
built as a static site.

## What this is

Every profile on the [Team](team.html) page is a real HTML/CSS page that
member built and PR'd in themselves, reviewed by a teammate, and merged
into `main`. There are no demo members and no shared "profile card"
template controlling everyone's layout — each person's page is their own
HTML and CSS, which is the point: it's a low-stakes place to practice and
show front-end skills on something real. The Team page itself is just a
lightweight directory that links out to each person's page.

### How the directory works

`team.html` doesn't hardcode anyone's info. On load, `js/team.js`:

1. Reads `team/members/index.json` for the list of member folder names.
2. Fetches each member's own `index.html`.
3. Reads four `<meta name="tse:*">` tags out of that page's `<head>`
   (name, role, tagline, GitHub link) to build a small card.
4. Links the card to that member's real page.

Everything below the `<head>` of a member's page — every element, class,
and style — is entirely up to them.

## Running locally

This is a static site with no build step, but the Team page fetches
files, which most browsers block over `file://`. Serve the folder
instead:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Any static file server works — Python's is just built in on most machines.

## How to contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full fork → branch → PR →
review → merge workflow, including how to add your own profile page.

## Roadmap

V1 ships Home, About, and a Team directory pointing at empty, member-owned
HTML/CSS pages. Later versions are expected to let each member add
courses, daily progress logs, goals, and projects to their own page —
in whatever markup they choose, since there's no shared schema to
outgrow.
